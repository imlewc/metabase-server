# metabase-server MCP Server

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@imlewc/metabase-server)](https://smithery.ai/server/@imlewc/metabase-server)

A Model Context Protocol server for Metabase integration.

This is a TypeScript-based MCP server that implements integration with Metabase API. It allows AI assistants to interact with Metabase, providing access to:

- Dashboards, questions/cards, and databases as resources
- Tools for listing and executing Metabase queries
- Ability to view and interact with Metabase data

## Features

### Resources
- List and access Metabase resources via `metabase://` URIs
- Access dashboards, cards/questions, and databases
- JSON content type for structured data access

### Tools
- `list_dashboards` - List all dashboards in Metabase
- `list_cards` - List all questions/cards in Metabase
- `list_databases` - List all databases in Metabase
- `execute_card` - Execute a Metabase question/card and get results
- `get_dashboard_cards` - Get all cards in a dashboard
- `execute_query` - Execute a SQL query against a Metabase database

## Configuration

Before running the server, you need to set environment variables for authentication. The server supports two methods:

1.  **API Key (Preferred):**
    *   `METABASE_URL`: The URL of your Metabase instance (e.g., `https://your-metabase-instance.com`).
    *   `METABASE_API_KEY`: Your Metabase API key.

2.  **Username/Password (Fallback):**
    *   `METABASE_URL`: The URL of your Metabase instance.
    *   `METABASE_USERNAME`: Your Metabase username.
    *   `METABASE_PASSWORD`: Your Metabase password.

The server will first check for `METABASE_API_KEY`. If it's set, API key authentication will be used. If `METABASE_API_KEY` is not set, the server will fall back to using `METABASE_USERNAME` and `METABASE_PASSWORD`. You must provide credentials for at least one of these methods.

**Example setup:**

Using API Key:
```bash
# Required environment variables
export METABASE_URL=https://your-metabase-instance.com
export METABASE_API_KEY=your_metabase_api_key
```

Or, using Username/Password:
```bash
# Required environment variables
export METABASE_URL=https://your-metabase-instance.com
export METABASE_USERNAME=your_username
export METABASE_PASSWORD=your_password
```
You can set these environment variables in your shell profile or use a `.env` file with a package like `dotenv`.

## Development

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

For development with auto-rebuild:
```bash
npm run watch
```

## Installation
```bash
# Oneliner, suitable for CI environment
git clone https://github.com/imlewc/metabase-server.git && cd metabase-server && npm i && npm run build && npm link
```

To use with Claude Desktop, add the server config:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "metabase-server": {
      "command": "metabase-server",
      "env": {
        "METABASE_URL": "https://your-metabase-instance.com",
        // Use API Key (preferred)
        "METABASE_API_KEY": "your_metabase_api_key"
        // Or Username/Password (if API Key is not set)
        // "METABASE_USERNAME": "your_username",
        // "METABASE_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: You can also set these environment variables in your system instead of in the config file if you prefer.

### Installing via Smithery

To install metabase-server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@imlewc/metabase-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @imlewc/metabase-server --client claude
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.

## Testing

After configuring the environment variables as described in the "Configuration" section, you can manually test the server's authentication. The MCP Inspector (`npm run inspector`) is a useful tool for sending requests to the server.

### 1. Testing with API Key Authentication

1.  Set the `METABASE_URL` and `METABASE_API_KEY` environment variables with your Metabase instance URL and a valid API key.
2.  Ensure `METABASE_USERNAME` and `METABASE_PASSWORD` are unset or leave them, as the API key should take precedence.
3.  Start the server: `npm run build && node build/index.js` (or use your chosen method for running the server, like via Claude Desktop config).
4.  Check the server logs. You should see a message indicating that it's using API key authentication (e.g., "Using Metabase API Key for authentication.").
5.  Using an MCP client or the MCP Inspector, try calling a tool, for example, `tools/call` with `{"name": "list_dashboards"}`.
6.  Verify that the tool call is successful and you receive the expected data.

### 2. Testing with Username/Password Authentication (Fallback)

1.  Ensure the `METABASE_API_KEY` environment variable is unset.
2.  Set `METABASE_URL`, `METABASE_USERNAME`, and `METABASE_PASSWORD` with valid credentials for your Metabase instance.
3.  Start the server.
4.  Check the server logs. You should see a message indicating that it's using username/password authentication (e.g., "Using Metabase username/password for authentication." followed by "Authenticating with Metabase using username/password...").
5.  Using an MCP client or the MCP Inspector, try calling the `list_dashboards` tool.
6.  Verify that the tool call is successful.

### 3. Testing Authentication Failures

*   **Invalid API Key:**
    1.  Set `METABASE_URL` and an invalid `METABASE_API_KEY`. Ensure `METABASE_USERNAME` and `METABASE_PASSWORD` variables are unset.
    2.  Start the server.
    3.  Attempt to call a tool (e.g., `list_dashboards`). The tool call should fail, and the server logs might indicate an authentication error from Metabase (e.g., "Metabase API error: Invalid X-API-Key").
*   **Invalid Username/Password:**
    1.  Ensure `METABASE_API_KEY` is unset. Set `METABASE_URL` and invalid `METABASE_USERNAME`/`METABASE_PASSWORD`.
    2.  Start the server.
    3.  Attempt to call a tool. The tool call should fail due to failed session authentication. The server logs might show "Authentication failed" or "Failed to authenticate with Metabase".
*   **Missing Credentials:**
    1.  Unset `METABASE_API_KEY`, `METABASE_USERNAME`, and `METABASE_PASSWORD`. Set only `METABASE_URL`.
    2.  Attempt to start the server.
    3.  The server should fail to start and log an error message stating that authentication credentials (either API key or username/password) are required (e.g., "Either (METABASE_URL and METABASE_API_KEY) or (METABASE_URL, METABASE_USERNAME, and METABASE_PASSWORD) environment variables are required").
